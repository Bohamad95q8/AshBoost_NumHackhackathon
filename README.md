Welcome to **ASHBoost's** repository for the NumHack Hackathon 2024. We are participating in the **Analyze Track**, showcasing our solution to analyze and extract insights using innovative techniques.  

---
## Overview
This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for matching contributors to AI projects using synthetic datasets. The results are analyzed and visualized as directed graphs, providing actionable insights and showcasing relationships between projects and contributors.

---

## How It Works
1. **Datasets**:
   - `AI_Projects_Populated_with_Summary.csv`: Contains project titles, required skills, summaries, and roles.
   - `Contributors_with_Summary.csv`: Contains contributor details, skills, summaries, and GitHub/portfolio links.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Match contributors to projects using SentenceTransformer embeddings and cosine similarity.
   - Generate compatibility scores for skills and project roles.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Use NetworkX and pyvis to create directed graphs showing project-contributor relationships.
   - Include dropdown menus for selecting projects and exploring skills dynamically.

---

## Frameworks and Techniques
### Frameworks
- **SentenceTransformers**: Used to encode textual summaries into embeddings.
- **NetworkX and pyvis**: For graph-based visualization of project-contributor relationships.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **IPython Widgets**: For interactive dropdown menus.

### Techniques
- Embedding generation for semantic similarity.
- Cosine similarity for skill matching.
- Directed graph representation to showcase relationships.

### Dataset
Synthetic datasets were generated to simulate real-world scenarios for proof of concept:
- Projects with required skills, summaries, and roles.
- Contributors with expertise summaries and portfolios.

---

## Findings, Difficulties, and Limitations
### Findings
- Graph visualization effectively highlights relationships and compatibility.
- Dropdown menus provide an intuitive interface for data exploration.

### Difficulties
- Handling diverse skill representations in synthetic data.
- Balancing graph clarity with the number of nodes and edges.

### Limitations
- Synthetic data lacks the complexity of real-world datasets.
- Matching relies heavily on embeddings and may require real-world calibration.

---

## Future Directions
- Incorporate real-world datasets for validation and refinement.
- Implement machine learning-based recommendation systems for matching.
- Scale graph visualizations for larger datasets and communities.
